## About the Project

I'm using this to get some more practice and to more clearly understand the development of a project from start to finish. It helps to see how other people implement a rails project and what steps they take to get it done. 

This is a supplement to what I'm learing at Coder Factory.


## Requirements

- Ruby 2.0 or later.
- Ruby on Rails 5.0 or later.
- Devise authentication by plataformatec.
- Simple Form form generator by plataformatec.

## Installation

All the appropriate gems have been added to the applications gem file. Once cloned and in the directory just run:

   `$ bundle`

## Usage

Clone the directory onto local drive. Cd into the directory. Then execute:

`$ rails s`

In browser navigate to:

`localhost:3000`

## Known Bugs

- No known bugs atm.
